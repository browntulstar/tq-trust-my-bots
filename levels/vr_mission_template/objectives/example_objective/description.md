Killjoy is doing some tinkering on her alarm bots but lost the documentation to her 3.07 patched version of them. She needs your help to find the numbers to her newest alarm bots so that they can be balanced and used against the enemy team.

In order to do this, you will need to go into a **Custom Match** with a friend of yours and test the behavior of the alarm bot, including its proximity sensors and damage output. 

## Task

Log your findings in your report that the rest of the team will read. Well, did anyone read the report? I hope they do. Afterwards, click the _HACK_ button.
